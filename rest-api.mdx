title: "REST API Overview"
---

The REST API serves as the primary method for initializing data and fetching historical states before subscribing to real-time WebSockets.

It is designed for stateless, request-response interactions and is perfect for:
- Initial data loading (Sports, Leagues, Matches)
- Filtering and Pagination
- Polling (if WebSockets are unavailable or unneeded)

<Note>
The REST API is *not* real-time. For low-latency live scores, incidents, and match status updates, you must use the WebSocket API.
</Note>

## REST vs WebSocket: When to Use Which

| Scenario | Use REST | Use WebSocket |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Initial page load (sports, leagues) | Yes | No |
| Fetching match list with filters | Yes | No |
| Live score updates on a dashboard | No | Yes (`matches:live`) |
| Real-time goal/card notifications | No | Yes (`match:{id}`) |
| Live statistics widget | No | Yes (`match:{id}`) |
| Fetching stream URLs | Yes | No |
| Historical match data | Yes | No |
| Environments without persistent connections | Yes (polling) | No |

<Info>
**Best practice:** Use REST to load the initial state, then switch to WebSocket for real-time updates. This gives you fast page loads with live data.
</Info>

## Caching Recommendations

To reduce unnecessary API calls and improve performance:

| Resource | Suggested Cache TTL | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `/sports` | 24 hours | Sports list rarely changes |
| `/leagues` | 24 hours | Leagues rarely change mid-season |
| `/matches?status=scheduled` | 5 minutes | Schedule can change close to match time |
| `/matches?status=live` | Do not cache | Use WebSocket instead |
| `/matches/{id}` | 30 seconds | Use WebSocket for real-time, REST for initial load |
| `/matches/{id}?include=streams` | 5 minutes | Stream URLs are stable once available |

## Pagination

Endpoints that return lists (e.g., `/matches`) support pagination using `page` and `limit` query parameters.

- `page` (integer): The page number, starting at 1. Default: 1.
- `limit` (integer): The number of items per page. Maximum: 100. Default: 20.

```http
GET /v1/matches?page=2&limit=50
```

The response metadata will include pagination details:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 50,
    "total": 350
  }
}
```

<Info>
**Pagination best practice:** Use a reasonable `limit` (20-50). Requesting `limit=100` on every call increases response time and consumes more rate limit budget.
</Info>

## Filtering & Sorting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Filtering">
    You can filter results using specific query parameters on supported endpoints. Common filters include:

    - `sport_id` (string): Filter by a specific sport.
    - `league_id` (string): Filter by a specific league.
    - `status` (string): Filter by match status (e.g., `live`, `scheduled`, `completed`).

    Filters can be combined:

    ```http
    GET /v1/matches?sport_id=1&league_id=39&status=live
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sorting">
    Sorting is available on lists using the `sort` parameter. Prefix the field name with a minus sign (`-`) for descending order.

    - `sort=start_time` (Ascending)
    - `sort=-start_time` (Descending)

    ```http
    GET /v1/matches?sort=-start_time
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Response Format

All endpoints use the standard response wrapper. See [Response Format](/getting-started#response-format) for details.

## Enumerated Values

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match Status Values">
    Matches can have the following `status` values:

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `scheduled` | Match has not started yet |
    | `live` | Match is currently in progress |
    | `halftime` | Match is at half-time break |
    | `completed` | Match has ended |
    | `postponed` | Match has been postponed |
    | `cancelled` | Match has been cancelled |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Game Stage Values">
    The `game_stage` field indicates the current phase of a live football match.

    | Stage | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | `1H` | First half |
    | `HT` | Half-time |
    | `2H` | Second half |
    | `ET` | Extra time |
    | `PEN` | Penalty shootout |
    | `FT` | Full time |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Incident Types">
    Events returned in the `incidents` section of `/matches/{id}` have the following `type` values:

    | Type | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `goal` | Goal scored |
    | `own_goal` | Own goal |
    | `yellow_card` | Yellow card shown |
    | `red_card` | Red card shown |
    | `substitution` | Player substitution |
    | `var_decision` | VAR review decision |
    | `penalty` | Penalty awarded/taken |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Polling Recommendations

If you cannot use WebSocket for real-time updates, use these polling intervals:

| Endpoint | Interval | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `/matches?status=live` | 30 seconds | For live dashboards |
| `/matches/{id}` | 15-30 seconds | For match detail pages |
| `/matches?status=scheduled` | 5 minutes | Schedule rarely changes |
| `/sports`, `/leagues` | Once per day | Static data |

<Warning>
Do not poll `/matches?status=live` more frequently than every 30 seconds. For real-time updates, use the [WebSocket API](/websocket) instead — it's more efficient and won't consume your rate limit budget.
</Warning>
