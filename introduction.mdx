Welcome to the **AGG Aggregator Platform** API documentation.

AGG is a sports data aggregation platform that unifies match data, live scores, statistics, and streaming URLs from multiple upstream providers into a single API. Instead of integrating with N providers, you integrate once with AGG.

This documentation is aimed at **backend and frontend developers** building applications on top of AGG.

## Use Cases

AGG powers a wide range of client applications:

  <Card title="Live Sports Dashboard" icon="chart-network">
    Display live scores, match status, and statistics across multiple sports and leagues in real-time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time Analytics" icon="bolt">
    Consume real-time match events (goals, cards, VAR decisions) to power live analytics dashboards and push notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stream Aggregator" icon="play">
    Fetch and present multiple stream URLs (m3u8, flv, rtmp) with player fallback logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fantasy Sports App" icon="trophy">
    Pull player-level match events and statistics for fantasy scoring.
  </Card>

## Why AGG vs Direct Integrations

| | AGG | Direct Provider Integrations |
|---|---|---|
| **Integration effort** | Single API, single auth | N providers, N APIs, N auth flows |
| **Data normalization** | Unified schema across all providers | Different schemas per provider |
| **Stream aggregation** | All stream URLs in one response | Separate calls per provider |
| **Real-time delivery** | WebSocket with unified event types | Varies: polling, webhooks, SSE |
| **Maintenance** | AGG handles upstream changes | You maintain each integration |

## Supported Protocols

AGG exposes data through two primary protocols to cater to different integration needs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="REST API" icon="server" href="/rest-api">
    Used for initial data loads, historical data, fetching static structures (sports, leagues), and environments where WebSockets are not supported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WebSocket API" icon="wifi" href="/websocket">
    Designed for real-time updates. It delivers low-latency live scores, match status changes, incidents, and live statistics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Current Scope

- **Sports:** Football (Soccer) only. Contact your account manager for available leagues.
- **Provider-agnostic:** You never need to know which upstream provider a match or stream comes from.

<Note>
AGG aggregates and distributes stream **URLs** only — we do not host video content, transcode streams, or provide CDN services. Your application is responsible for video playback.
