AGG API and WebSocket protocols are versioned to ensure backward compatibility and smooth integrations for all clients.

## Versioning Strategy

The API version is included in the base URL:

- REST API: `https://api.agg.example.com/v1`
- WebSocket: `wss://ws.agg.example.com/ws`

When backwards-incompatible changes are introduced, the version number will be incremented (e.g., to `v2`).

Backwards-compatible changes (e.g., adding new fields to a response, introducing new endpoints) will not change the version number.

<Info>
Your client code must be resilient to receiving **new fields** in JSON responses. Never fail on unknown fields — simply ignore them. This allows us to add features without breaking your integration.

## Support Policy

| Version | Status | Support |
|---------|--------|---------|
| v1 | Current | Full support — bug fixes, new features, security patches |

When a new major version is released:

- The previous version enters a **12-month deprecation period**
- During deprecation, the old version receives security patches only
- After deprecation, the old version is sunset and may be removed

## Breaking Change Communication

When a breaking change is planned:

1. Announced via email to all registered merchants **at least 90 days** before release
2. Documented in the [Changelog](/changelog) with migration guides
3. Available in the **staging environment** for testing at least 30 days before production rollout
